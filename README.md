Google Developer Student Clubs(GSDC) final project at National Chengchi University, a house price search site using Django and Google API. The site receives an address entered by the user, or the current location of the user, and the range of distances the user wants to query. The site then displays recent home transactions within the required distance and marks them on the displayed map.
